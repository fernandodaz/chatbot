# Chatbot

This is a POC of a integration between an external interface with a backend-side application and a ChatGPT model. Be aware that bugs are possible there, this is a basic implementation and it is still in progress.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt to install the dependencies
```
## Usage
set in .env your ChatGPT apikey and then run python App.py

## Dockerization
You can use the dockerFile to build an image and then run the container. The application will be exposed in 8080 port by default.
